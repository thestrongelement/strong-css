USAGE:
  - main css brings along base, functions, mixins, layout, blocks, and non-dependent helpers
  @import "bower_components/strong-css/css/strong";
   
  - dependent helpers must be imported separately
  @import "bower_components/strong-css/css/helpers/backgrounds";

RULES:
  — $elements__blocks have default $margin-bottom, last-child has none
